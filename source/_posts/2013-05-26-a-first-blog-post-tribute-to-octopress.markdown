As a Software Developer, it is now kind of trendy to maintain a blog where you can share a few gits or titbits of code with the community.

Fortunatly, there are many tools out there to ease the process of creating a blog. And when you don't know html5 that well and are not very good with CSS either, some of these tools will make your life easier.

The new trendy tool that I found during my research and that I decided to use for my blog is <a href="http://octopress.org/">octopress</a>.
